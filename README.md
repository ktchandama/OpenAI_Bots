Creating chatbots with OpenAI API

In this repo, you can find the code used to create a chatbot with OpenAI API.

It's always a good practice to create a virtualenv first and execute the code in that environment.

**Use the following to create and activate the environment.**
$ python -m venv YourVenV
$ YourVenV\Scripts\activate.bat   #for Windows cmd
$ YourVenV\Scripts\activate.ps1   #for Windows Powershell
$ source YourVenV/bin/activate   # for a Linux based terminal

**To execute the code, run the command below:**
$ python app.py
